# Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-of-a-Foundation-Model
Lightweight Fine-Tuning of a Foundation Model (Hugging Face)

Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.
In this project, I apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library.

We follow the steps below;

1 - We load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance

2- Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model

3- Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
